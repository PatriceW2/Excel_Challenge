Three things we can conclude about about Kickstarter campaigns:
  1. The arts (theater, music, film & video) are most likely to have a kickstarter campaign.
      a. Theater by far has the most Kickstarter campaigns than any other category, this is true across the majority of countries
      b. All three are over 50% successful showing that people will help fund the arts 
  2. Technology is also a category that has a high number of kickstarter campaigns:
      a. Kickstarters supporting hardware technology is 100% successful
      b. Kickstarters supporting new web technology are more likely to fail
  3. Overall Kikstarters that start their campaign in the spring/2nd quarter are more likely to be successfull in reaching their goal
 
 
 Limitations of this data include lack of information for the long term success of these Kickstart campaigns.  It does not help answer the question on how long will the venture be successful after being initially funded by a Kickstarter.  Other limitations include the lack of regions per country which makes it be unable to determine if rural areas or cities have a higher percentage of being successful.
 
 Other possible tables/graphs that could be pulled from this data:
 
    1. A scatter chart that shows the average donation per campaign sub category to show which sub category received the highest average donation
    2. A line graph that shows aveerage finacial goal to hit per category,  which category usually asks for more funds?
